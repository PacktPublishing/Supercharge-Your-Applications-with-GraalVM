**Hands-on examples to optimize and extend your code using GraalVM's high performance and polyglot capabilities**
Gain a solid understanding of GraalVM and how it works under the hood
Work with GraalVM's high performance optimizing compiler and see how it can be used in both JIT (just-in-time) and AOT (ahead-of-time) modes
Get to grips with the various optimizations that GraalVM performs at runtime
Use advanced tools to analyze and diagnose performance issues in the code
Compile, embed, run, and interoperate between languages using Truffle on GraalVM
Build optimum microservices using popular frameworks such as Micronaut and Quarkus to create cloud-native applications
## What is this book about?
GraalVM is a universal virtual machine that allows programmers to embed, compile, interoperate, and run applications written in JVM languages such as Java, Kotlin, and Groovy; non-JVM languages such as JavaScript, Python, WebAssembly, Ruby, and R; and LLVM languages C and C++. 

This book covers the following exciting features:

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
@Fallback protected void typeError (Object left, Object right)
{
throw new TypeException("type error: args must be two integers or floats or two", this);
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for JVM developers looking to optimize their application's performance. You'll also find this book useful if you're a JVM developer looking to explore options to develop polyglot applications using tools from the Python, R, Ruby, or Node.js ecosystem. A solid understanding of software development concepts and prior experience working with programming languages is necessary to get started.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
